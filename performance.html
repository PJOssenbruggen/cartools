<p><strong>Highway Performance</strong></p>
<p>An important measure of highway performance is traffic flow, which we denote as <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. It is the number of vehicles that pass a point in unit time. Typically, it is reported in vehicles per hour (vph). A principal product of this effort is the development of a probability model that treats traffic flow <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> as a random variable:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Q = f(U, k, l, h)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is a function of the random variable <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, traffic density <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, measured in vehicles per unit length, vehicle length <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and distance headway <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. Additionally, <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is assumed to be a <em>safe driving distance</em> that reflects the drivers aversion to risk. Since all drivers are assumed to maintain a safe headway, no crashes are permitted under the assumptions of this model. As the vehicular speed increases, the safe driving distance as defined by a deterministic function of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <em>fundamental relationship</em>,</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(q = k * u\)</span>,</li>
</ul>
<p>defines <span class="math inline">\(q, k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> as deterministic variables. Field test are used in this study. A radar device was used to measure the speed of each vehicle and count the number of vehicles <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as they pass a point along a highway over a given time interval <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. The speed and flow for <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> are recorded as an average speed <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(q = n/\tau\)</span>. The traffic density is estimated as <span class="math inline">\(k = q/u\)</span>. All estimated values for <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> are treated as constants. There were 96 recordings of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> per day. It will be shown presently that these recordings are highly volatile recordings. Since they vary over the course of a day and day-by-day, why arenot all these variables treated as random variables? This question will be deferred and discussed presently.</p>
<p>The random variable model <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is a <em>parsimonius, stochastic model.</em></p>
<p>The overall volatility of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is assumed to be a measure of driver group dynamics and other uncertainties.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(U = f(u, \sigma)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Let us get started by investigating a <em>traffic breakdown event</em>, an event that triggers the onset of congestion event. As all drivers know from experience, the highway will be is a congested depending on how many vehicles are on the highway. The <em>triggering mechanism</em> is the vehicle count. Some drivers may observe that a highway with seemingly the same number of the vehicles on the highway may or may not be in a congested state. Knowing the vehicle count is important but insufficien evidence in predicting the onset of congestion with <em>certainty.</em>. Regardless, some drivers may alter their trip plan to avoid dealing with a congestion event or the possibility of being involved in a crash.</p>
<p>In place of a subjective analysis, field data will be collected and analyzed. To simplify the discussion, we will assume the data are collected at the same site over an extended time period, say, months. With these data, the proportion of congestion events can be estimated as <span class="math inline">\(p = m/n\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the congestion events and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of days of the study. To perform this calculation, we define congestion as a critical speed <span class="math inline">\(u^*\)</span>, a speed that separates a congested state from a free-flow (uncongested) state. The proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, a measure of performance, can be refined. Say, to estimate the performance of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> for rush hour traffic. For this estimate to have meaning, we must define rush hour traffic. It is defined as a time-of-day where traffic is deemed to be “heavy.” It is measured as a traffic flow <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in vehicles per hour (vph). <span class="math inline">\(q = n/\tau\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a vehicle count over time period <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. The rush hour speed, in actually, is an average speed of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vehicles observed over the 15-minute time period. The rush hour speed <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and flow <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> are aggreates.</p>
<p>The estimates of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, whether it is estimated with daily or hourly count data, and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> are measures of <em>past performance</em>. Our transportation operation and management plan deals with the <em>future.</em> By necessity, the probability of a traffic breakdown event, <span class="math inline">\(\pi = P(U &lt; u^*)\)</span> will replace <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and the random value <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> will replace <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. Since highway geometry or some other improvement will be made, <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> models must be carefully selected and model parameters estimated.</p>
<p>To make reliable predictions a reality, <em>the root cause of a traffic breakdown must be identified and understood</em>. The so-called <strong>Ring Road Experiment</strong> conducted by <span class="citation">Sugiyama et al. (2008)</span> is <em>a controlled experiment</em> that brings insight to the complex nature of identifying what triggers traffic breakdown.</p>
<p>This experiment differs fundamentally from the field study described above. Here, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the number of vehicles over the duration of the study, was fixed. Next, these vehicles were driven around a loop road where no vehicles were allowed to enter or exit. Finally, the drivers were instructed to maintain a constant speed <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and constant safe headway <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. The YouTube video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wm-pZp_mi0" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wm-pZp_mi0</a>, shows the drivers were unable to follow these simple instructions. The volatility in speed, denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> and called <em>traffic noise</em> explains the result. An added bonus of this experiment it allows the process to be described by a simple probability model of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, highway bottlenecks and traffic merging were analyzed using field data. The speed data were treated as time-series data and placed in bins according the number of speed recordings observed over a stretch of 15-minutes. There are <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> = 1,2, …, 96 bins in a 24-hour day. The average speed for each bin is calculated and recorded as <span class="math inline">\(u_1, u_2, ..., u_{96}\)</span>; the number of speed observations by bin sample size, <span class="math inline">\(n_1, n_2, ..., n_{96}\)</span>, are recorded; and the traffic flows <span class="math inline">\(q_1, q_2, ..., q_{96}\)</span> are estimated as <span class="math inline">\(q_i = n_i/\tau\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> equals 15-minutes. With the aid of the fundamental relationship <span class="math inline">\(q = k * u\)</span>, the traffic density <span class="math inline">\(k_i = q_i/u_i\)</span> can be determined. Visual inspection, scatter plots, etc., of the <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(k_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u_i\)</span> help explain traffic breakdown and highway performance. including the use of computer simulation and animation are used to increase understanding of complex traffic behavior.</p>
<p>A principal product of this effort is the development of a probabilistic traffic flow model:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Q = f(U; k, h)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>where speed is treated as a random variable <span class="math inline">\(U = g(u, \sigma)\)</span> where speed <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, the standard deviation of speed <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, traffic density <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and safe headway <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> are constant values. The overall volatility of the process is specified by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, which is assumed to be a measure of driver group dynamics and other uncertainties. The <em>safe distance headway</em> <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> reflects the drivers aversion to risk. Additionally, <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is assumed to be a <em>deterministic</em> function of the constant speed <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and vehicle length. Since all drivers are assumed to maintain a safe headway, no crashes are permitted. Thus, the model of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is an important measure of highway performance and a <em>parsimonius, stochastic model.</em></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is fixed and speed varies over time and is treated as a random variable <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, the fundamental relationship is written as <span class="math inline">\(Q = nU/l\)</span> where the road length is <span class="math inline">\(l = 2\pi r\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> equal to the radius of the loop road. Returning to the question of the better model, <span class="math inline">\(\pi = P(Q = q)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\pi = P(K = k)\)</span>, the answer is <span class="math inline">\(\pi = P(U = u)\)</span>. The <em>root causes of traffic breakdown</em> in this experiment are: (1) the inability of the drivers to maintain a constant speed, and (2) the drivers need to accelerate and decelerate to maintain a safe distance between themselves and the vehicles in front of them or safe headways. The <em>optimum driving condition</em> is defined to be time it takes an indivual driver to complete a loop at speed <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. The delay is estimated as the extra time for a driver to complete a loop. To explain this scenario, the stationary time-series model of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is introduced and the calibration of this model is discussed.</p>
<p>No question that designing and operating a transportation system are difficult problems. By disecting the problem into manageable pieces and synthesizing the results from the individual pieces brings clarity to the process.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Noise</strong></p>
<p>A quick read of the <strong>Overview</strong> may give the impression that the approach, a package of computer algorithms, will be difficult to understand and overwhelming to implement. Words, like complex, dynamics, theory, parsimonious, stochastic and model integration can be daunting. No question that designing and operating a transportation system are difficult problems. By disecting the problem into manageable pieces and synthesizing the results from the individual pieces brings clarity to the process.</p>
<p>The mathematics behind the animation is relatively simple. Of course, the Brownian motion model shown here can be adapted to other situtations. This will be illustrated presently. The ultimate aim of using <a href="https://github.com/PJOssenbruggen/Basic">trfhp</a> package tools is to improve our chances of mitigating congestion and improving performance using the simple mathematical and graphical tools.</p>
