<h1 class="title toc-ignore">The Ring-Road Experiment</h1>

</div>


<p><strong>A Controlled Experiment</strong></p>
<p>We continue our model building effort by simulating conditions observed on a <em>ring</em> or <em>loop road</em>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wm-pZp_mi0">YouTube video</a> shows <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 22 vehicles <span class="citation">(Sugiyama et al. 2008)</span>. The drivers cannot pass one another or enter or exit the loop. Each driver was instructed to maintain a same constant speed <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. The drivers cannot follow instructions. After a few sections, the traffic breaks down.</p>
<p>Why? The video shows the vehicles to traveling at a reasonable speed. Initially, all vehicles are uniformly distributed around the circle. After a few seconds, the vehicles begin to interact because the drivers cannot maintain a constant speed. If we track a vehicle, we can see the speed will vary by a slight amount. Since their no room to move laterally, the drivers must follow and react to the situation directly in front of them.</p>
<p>This behavior is a classic definition of <em>car-following.</em> The spacing between between vehicles, while it appears to be sufficient, is not. If other words, the traffic density <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is sufficiently large to cause the vehicles to interact, thus driving in a <em>congested state</em>. If there were fewer vehicles, i.e., driving in a <em>free-flow state</em>, then an individual driver could adjust his or her vehicle without affecting the vehicle behind it.</p>
<p><strong>A Brownian Bridge Model of Speed</strong></p>
<p>Can we explain this behavior mathematically? Consider the following approach:</p>
<p>First, assume the speed of a vehicle to be the random variable <span class="math inline">\(U(t)\)</span> and assume the process is defined by a stationary time-series model of the form:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(U(t) = u + \sigma Z\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the assigned speed as specified by the experiment and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is a standard deviation of speed, <span class="math inline">\(Z \sim N(0,1)\)</span> is a standard normal probability distribution and time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is measured in seconds.</p>
<p>The next question is how do we assign the model parameters? It is clear that <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the assigned experiment speed but what is its magnitude? The box plot of speed-density from our exploratory analyses showed a connection of speed and density. The following density-speed plot is a cleaner version of the box plot.</p>
<p><img src="Ring-Road_files/figure-html/density-speed-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>The traffic density <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is controlled by the number of vehicles on the road <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and ring-road radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(k = n/2\pi r\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, select <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p>Assigning <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> are not clear-cut as originally envisioned. For one, <span class="math inline">\(U(t)\)</span> is a <em>microscale model</em> where driver reaction takes place on a time-scale of seconds and the density-speed plot is a <em>macroscale model</em> derived from 15-minute average data or <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> data. The scales are incompatable.</p>
<p>Second, the stationary time-series <span class="math inline">\(U(t)\)</span> model does not adequately explain driver behavior. Define the time-step equal to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t = t_i - t_{i-1}\)</span> and for purposes of illustration, let <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> = 1 second. Given <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> takes on both positive and negative values, a simulation can predict vehicle speeds flip-flopping back and forth from one second to the next. Obviously, a normal driver does not drive sporatically as described by the model. This flaw is rectified by replacing the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma Z\)</span> term with a Brownian motion term or:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(U(t) = u + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} Z = u + \sigma W(t)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math inline">\(W(t) = \sqrt{\Delta t} Z\)</span> term defines Brownian motion and is called the Wiener process. A driver will more smoothly accelerate or decelerate but without limit. Over an extended period of time, say <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> = 15 minutes, speeds can reach extraordinary high or low speeds (negative traveling backwards) with this model. Of course, this is another unacceptable model.</p>
<p>This problem is overcome by replacing <span class="math inline">\(W(t)\)</span> with a Brownian bridge model:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(U(t) = u + \Lambda (W(t) - t/\tau * W(\tau))\)</span>,</li>
</ul>
<p>as the following diagram illustrates for “Congested Flow at HCM Capacity” (HCM = Highway Capacity Manual) and “Heavly Congested” simulations for two <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> assignments. After time <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> = 15 minutes, the model forces a driver to travel at speed <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> = 15 minutes.</p>
<p><img src="Ring-Road_files/figure-html/bridge-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>Finally, there is a need for <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>, the correction factor. If <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> is assigned the value of 1, then the model can predict more volatile traffic speeds than shown here. By volatile the speeds can fall well outside its 95% confidence interval. The assignment of <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> used an ad hoc, subjective procedure. A series of simulations for a given <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>. If two many simulations fell outside the 95% CI, it was adjusted until was felt to be representative of the situation being simulated.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(U(t)\)</span> model, a mechanistic model, <em>explains</em> driver behavior. A driver will travel at a speed in the neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> over the time period from 0 to <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> = 15 minutes as common sense tells us.</p>
<p><strong>Time-Distance Trajectories</strong></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(U(t)\)</span> model was subject to another test. Does the model predict driver behavior that is similar to that shown in the YouTube video? A same instructions given to the drivers of the Yuki Sugiyama experiment are assumed for the computer simulation that produced the following <span class="math inline">\(t-x\)</span> trajectories. The drivers are instructed to maintain a constant speed <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and headway <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. The vehicles are evenly placed along the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis at <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = 0.</p>
<p><img src="Ring-Road_files/figure-html/ringroad1-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>As in the full-scale experiment, the simulated drivers cannot maintain a constant speed or even spacing. After a few seconds, the vehicles begin to interact and form clusters (moving queues) and the traffic breaks down. <em>Clearly, traffic volatility plays an important role.</em></p>
<p><strong>Highway Safety</strong></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(U(t)\)</span> model incorporates two important features: (1) <em>driver performance in a car-following situation</em> and (2) <em>safety</em>. All drivers are assumed to maintain a <em>safe driving distance</em> when driving in the congested or free-flow states or</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(h_{safe} = f(u)\)</span>,</li>
</ul>
<p>which depends on the vehicle speed <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. The safety effects are most easily explained with the use of the dotted lines shown in the figures above. The dotted straight line is the trajectory of the lead vehicle, assuming that its driver could maintain a constant speed. Since <span class="math inline">\(x = u * t\)</span>, the slope of the dotted straight line is <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. Consider a pair of vehicles, one designated as a <em>leader</em> and the other one designated as a <em>follower</em>. At each time-step, the locations and speeds of the lead and following vehicles and the headway between the two vehicles are calculated. If there is a safe headway violation, the following vehicle locations and speeds are adjusted to eliminate the violation. If the lead vehicle slows, the following vehicle must slowdown to avoid a crash if too close. Under a less dense condition, the drivers can vary their speeds without affecting one another.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Flow</strong></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a constant, <span class="math inline">\(k = n/2\pi r\)</span> is a constant. The flow is a random variable, defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Q(t) = k * U(t)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The volatility in <span class="math inline">\(Q(t)\)</span> is explained exclusively by the volatility in <span class="math inline">\(U(t)\)</span> as defined by the Brownian bridge model of speed.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(Q(t) = k * U(t)\)</span> model suggests a <em>cause-effect relationship</em> exists. The speed as specified by <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> are the causal factors and <span class="math inline">\(Q(t)\)</span> is the response variable. The probability of being in a congested state is forecast to be a function of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\pi(k)\)</span>.</p>
