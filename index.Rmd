The material presented in __TFUHP__ is developed from various sources, including full scale testing, transportation textbooks, research classified as _traffic flow theory_, and probability models. The following is an extremely small sample of the resources used in this development:

* Full Scale Testing: @1367-2630-10-3-033001

* Textbooks: @banks:1998, @deganzo:1997, @LiliBook, @trieber

* Research: @pjo2017 

* Probability Modeling: @iacus, @sde

knitr::include_graphics("IEEE_MT-ITS.pdf", auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", TRUE))
