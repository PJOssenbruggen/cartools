__An Open-Source Project__

Users are encouraged to freely use any of the material used to create this package. Clink on the following links to access information about __cartools__:  

1. [Code](https://github.com/PJOssenbruggen/Basic/blob/master/vignettes/cartools.Rmd): This 'GitHub' repository contains the  __cartools__ functions  and data sets.

2. [Website](https://PJOssenbruggen.github.io/cartools/index.html): This 'GitHub Pages' website: (a)  provides instruction for using the __cartools__ code and its various algorithms for solving a variety of transportation problems; and (b) gives justification, a detailed in depth look at basic principles, for using the code to help answer the fundamental question: 

> _How can we mitigate traffic congestion when a traffic breakdown event is so difficult to predict?_

People familiar with [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) may download, use and share this material as they see fit. Feedback is welcomed.

__Purpose__

The primary purpose of this website deals with transportation engineering, operations and management. I would remiss in not drawing attention to the major advances made in computer science and statistics that enhance learning.  

_Animation_ and _interactive graphics_ bring new perspectives into understanding both old and new ideas. Take a brief look at [gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles) showing an _animated scatter plot_ of life expectancy over the last 200 years and [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/bus-dashboard.html) showing an _interactive bus route map_. At the time of this writing, the animated and interactive features have not been initiated. These features have been implemented on my local computer and will be made available soon. 


__Challenges__

Now lets turn attention to transportation issues.

"In many industrialized nations today, highways present engineers and governments with formidable challenges relating to safety, sustainability, environmental impacts, congestion mitigation, and deteriorating infrastructure. As a result, highways are often viewed from a perspective of the many challenges as they present as opposed to the benefits that they provide. [@mannering]" 

__Focus:__ 

> How can we mitigate traffic congestion when a traffic breakdown event is so difficult to predict?

_Hypothesis:_ The following variables can (1) explain and (2) predict a traffic breakdown event: 

$n$ = traffic count (number of vehicles), measured as a traffic density, $k$ in vehicles per mile (vpm), 

$\sigma$ = traffic noise, measured as speed volatility, 

$h_{safe} = f(u, l_{eff})$, a function of speed $u$ and vehicle length $l_{eff}$, and

driver behavior and road design (geometry). 


__Aims__
 
The __cartools__ package is designed for college students studying transportation engineering and for transportation professionals and researchers interested in understanding the complex relationships associated with freeway performance and traffic breakdown. Emphasis is placed on: 

* _Traffic noise or volatility_.

* _Driver behavior and safety_. 

* _Stochastic modeling_,  models that explain breakdown and performance.


The website contains the following menu  items:

1. ##### __Drivers:__  _Self Optimizers_. Meeting the challenges.

2. ##### __Noise:__  _Traffic noise or  volatility_. Exploratory data analysis of a congested freeway bottleneck.

3. ##### __Ring-Road:__ _Driver behavior and safety_. A "controlled" car-following experiment on a single lane road.

4. #####  __Bottleneck:__ _Determinstic models_. Traffic merging at a bottleneck where two-lanes  combine to form one lane.

5. #####  __Zipper Merge:__ _Wishful thinking_. An "ideal" merge" at a bottleneck.

6. #####  __Breakdown:__ _Modeling reality_. A stochastic traffic breakdown model.

7. #####  __Capacity:__ _Highway performance_. Measuring performance as a capacity.

8. #####  __Crossover__ _Lane changing_. The potential for queue formation due to weaving.

9. ##### __Smart Mobility:__ _Intelligent Transportation Systems._ Moving forward with innovative technology.

10. ##### __Summary:__  __cartools__ package highlights.


The principal aim of the __cartools__ package is to explain highway performance as simply as possible. Topics are introduced in a  step-by-step manner.  The  __cartools__ package is derived and developed from a diverse set of resources:

* _Traffic analysis:_ @banks:1998, @deganzo:1997, @LiliBook, @pjo2017, @1367-2630-10-3-033001, @trieber
