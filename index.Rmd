__An Open-Source Project__

Users are encouraged to freely use any of the material used to create this package. Click on the following links to access information about __cartools__:  

1. [Code](https://github.com/PJOssenbruggen/Basic/blob/master/vignettes/cartools.Rmd): This 'GitHub' repository contains the  __cartools__ functions  and data sets.

2. [Website](https://PJOssenbruggen.github.io/cartools/index.html): This 'GitHub Pages' website: (a)  provides instruction for using the __cartools__ code and its various algorithms for solving a variety of transportation problems; and (b) gives justification, a detailed in depth look at basic principles, for using the code to help answer the fundamental questions. Real-world problems are investigated.  


People familiar with [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) may download, use and share this material as they see fit. Feedback is welcomed.

__Purpose__

The primary purpose of this website deals with transportation engineering, operations and management. I would remiss in not drawing attention to the major advances made in computer science and statistics that enhance learning.  

_Animation_ and _interactive graphics_ bring new perspectives into understanding both old and new ideas. Take a brief look at [gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles) showing an _animated scatter plot_ of life expectancy over the last 200 years and [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/bus-dashboard.html) showing an _interactive bus route map_. At the time of this writing, the animated and interactive features have not been initiated. These features have been implemented on my local computer and will be made available soon. 

__Challenges__

Now lets turn attention to transportation issues.

"In many industrialized nations today, highways present engineers and governments with formidable challenges relating to safety, sustainability, environmental impacts, congestion mitigation, and deteriorating infrastructure. As a result, highways are often viewed from a perspective of the many challenges as they present as opposed to the benefits that they provide. [@mannering]" 

__Focus:__ The __cartools__ package and this website focus on traffic congestion mitigation. We pose a most perplexing question: 

> How can we mitigate traffic congestion when a traffic breakdown event is so difficult to predict?

A roadway can operate normally on one day and on the next day, be congested. Obviously, traffic conditions change from day-to-day, They  also change on a finer time-scale from second-to-second. In __cartools__, we treat these uncertainties or chance events with probability. The trick is to identity those factors that can reliably predict a _traffic breakdown event_, an event when the average speed will falls below some pre-defined level. 

The list of factors that explains a traffic breakdown event is long. In due time, we explore these factors. But for now, consider one of these factors, _driver behavior_. Drivers are described as safe, aggressive (speeders, tailgaters), reckless (text while driving), inattentive and so on. We will see that under ideal conditions, drivers, who are determined to maintain a specified speed, are unable to do so. Human frailty is part of the driver behavior mix. 

Obviously, solving the traffic breakdown puzzle requires a comprehensive knowledge of the individual elements of the driver behavior mix and those factors that influence driver behavior and traffic demand:  traffic management, law enforcement,  roadway design,  monetary (out-of-pocket) and human costs (crash risk), transport mode competition and technology.  

In __cartools__, the strategy is to break this puzzle into more manageable parts, explore each part, and then reassemble the parts in a meaningful way. Fundamental principles of transportation, probability, statistics  and visual imagery, graphics, are the principle means of exploring a part or an assembly of parts with __cartools__. The website contains the following menu  items, which we call the _manageable parts_:

1. ##### __Drivers:__  _Self Optimizers_. Meeting the challenges.

2. ##### __Noise:__  _Traffic noise or  volatility_. Exploratory data analysis of a congested freeway bottleneck.

3. ##### __Ring-Road:__ _Driver behavior and safety_. A "controlled" car-following experiment on a single lane road.

4. #####  __Bottleneck:__ _Determinstic models_. Traffic merging at a bottleneck where two-lanes  combine to form one lane.

5. #####  __Zipper Merge:__ _Wishful thinking_. An "ideal" merge" at a bottleneck.

6. #####  __Breakdown:__ _Modeling reality_. A stochastic traffic breakdown model.

7. #####  __Capacity:__ _Highway performance_. Measuring performance as a capacity.

8. #####  __Crossover__ _Lane changing_. The potential for queue formation due to weaving.

9. ##### __Smart Mobility:__ _Intelligent Transportation Systems._ Moving forward with innovative technology.

10. ##### __Summary:__  __cartools__ package highlights.


The principal aim of the __cartools__ package is to explain highway performance as simply as possible. These topics are introduced in a  step-by-step manner.  The  __cartools__ package is derived and developed from a diverse set of resources:
