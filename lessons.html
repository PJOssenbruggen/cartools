<p><strong>Intelligent Transportion Systems</strong></p>
<p>As we carefully review the outcomes of the simulations derived from various deterministic and stochastic models, we must conclude that self-optimizing drivers are working against their own self interest of moving forward with no or minimum delay. Contrast the assumptions of the <strong>Zipper Merge</strong> and <strong>Traffic Breakdown Part 6</strong> simulations.</p>
<p>The <strong>Zipper Merge</strong> simulation assumes that drivers act in concert to align themselves before merging. The analysis suggests that drivers can successful merge at any speed, suggesting that high speed merges can take place. There is no empirical evidence to prove this contention other than observing drivers on a race track.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Breakdown Part 6</strong> simulations assume that drivers act individually. Drivers, who have no incentive to give their counterparts room to maneuver, promote delay. This kind of self-serving behavior is not new to traffic operations. It is known as <em>Braess’s Paradox</em> <span class="citation">(Braess, Nagurney, and Walkobinger 2005)</span>. It has been shown both with mathematical modeling and with empirical evidence that closing certain roads in a roadway network can improve service. For example, <span class="citation">Roughgarden and Tardos (2002)</span> reported that total delay using convex programming for a simple idealized network would be one-third greater for a “non-optimum” network than for an “optimum” network.</p>
<p>Some people may claim that counter intuitive methods as suggested by the <em>Braess’s Paradox</em> approach has no application to traffic breakdown at a bottleneck or at a lane drop. It is far-fetched notion to assume the geometric layout of an interstate freeway interchange, say, can be improved in any meaningful or practical way. Secondly, training drivers to change their habits is social engineering requiring unobtainable behavioral changes. For example, drivers are taught that the right and left freeway lanes are reserved for slower and higher speed travel, respectively. Take any freeway of your choosing and observe that this teaching is not enforced by law enforcement and ignored by the driving public. Tailgating is common practice. Thirdly and finally, critics can claim that the deterministic <strong>Zipper Merge</strong> model disregards traffic volatility, therefore it ignores a most fundamental premise of the work presented here in the <strong>cartools</strong> package.</p>
<p>These are formidable criticisms. However, we have not considered controlling traffic noise while leaving individual driver behavior alone. How can this be done? An answer may be to apply <em>Intelligent Transportion Systems</em> (<em>ITS</em>) in a <em>smart city environment</em>. Consider this proof of concept:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Collect real-time data. Data collected with lidar and radar equipment placed roadside or collected on-board a vehicle with a GPS system. Measures, including location <span class="math inline">\(x_{vehicle}(t)\)</span> and speed <span class="math inline">\(u_{vehicle}(t)\)</span> data will be transmitted using wireless technology and stored on a central controller computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a <strong>brkzipper</strong> forecast algorithm. The algorithm will be created along the lines of the <strong>Zipper Merge</strong> and <strong>Traffic Breakdown Part 6</strong> models. In lieu of simulating zipper and traffic breakdown merges, <strong>brktrials</strong> algorithm will be designed to forecast <span class="math inline">\(\hat{x}_{vehicle}(t)\)</span> locations and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{u}_{vehicle}(t)\)</span> speeds at future times of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Transmit the forecasts back to the vehicles. To be effective, drivers will relinquish control of their vehicles and an on-board control will be used. The on-board systems are contemplated to be autonomous units similar in operation to autonomous cruise control (ACC) devices used on contemporary vehicles sold today.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Capacity</strong></p>
<p>Throughout our discussion of <strong>cartools</strong>, we have intentionally avoided discussing roadway capacity, a topic that has received much attention. So, what is correct value of capacity? The best answer is “It depends.” Consider the <em>HCM</em> guidelines give a range of capacity values from 2250 to 2400 vph on the geometric design associated with the free-mean speed. <span class="citation">(Laflamme and Ossenbruggen 2018)</span> give a range from 2400 to 2700 vph. Their approach uses an extreme-value value estimation approach and the analysis of maximum daily flow data including censored data. The estimation method helps explain why their capacity range is greater than the <em>HCM</em>.</p>
<p>Using these ranges for comparison, let’s look at the estimation of capacity using the results obtained with <strong>cartools.</strong> Before doing so, consider the definition of capacity that has been refined over the years. <span class="citation">Elefteriadou (2014)</span> defines the <em>HCM</em> capacity as a “maximum obtainable flow rate.” She recognizes the difficulties of estimating and assigning capacity owing to the volatility of the field data. Using this definition, we will solve the problem by treating it as a maximization problem with an objection function to “maximize throughput.” Thus, we rewrite out <span class="math inline">\(Q(t) = k * U(t)\)</span> model where <span class="math inline">\(U(t) = U(k, u, \sigma, h_{safe}, t)\)</span> as:</p>
<ul>
<li>maximize <span class="math inline">\(Q^* = k^* * \bar{u}(k^*)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution seems straightforward enough. Select <span class="math inline">\(k^*\)</span>. However, we must remind ourselves that we are dealing with volatile field data. As a reminder, the following two plots are reproduced.</p>
<p><img src="lessons_files/figure-html/uk_sdkplot-1.png" width="384" /></p>
<p><img src="lessons_files/figure-html/logisticplots-1.png" width="384" /></p>
<p>The following graph uses this information to aid in the decision-making. “Success” refers to the probability that the roadway is operating in a free-flow state, <span class="math inline">\(P(X = 0) = 1 - \pi\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="lessons_files/figure-html/capacityplot-1.png" width="384" /></p>
<p>The “maximum throughput” is <span class="math inline">\(Q^*\)</span> = 2400 vph and <span class="math inline">\(P(X = 0)\)</span> = 0.13 at <span class="math inline">\(k^*\)</span> = 40 vph. The importance of <span class="math inline">\(k^*\)</span> is clearly evident. For example at <span class="math inline">\(k = 45\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(X = 0)\)</span> = 0.6 and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> = 2340 vph. At <span class="math inline">\(k &gt; k^*\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(X = 0)\)</span> performance measures suffer.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Cities and the Internet of Things</strong></p>
<p>Controlling traffic noise by using <em>ITS</em> in a <em>smart city environment</em>, as suggested above, is expected to boost performance even further than presented here. The key questions are: “(1) By how much, (2) who is interested, and (3) who can supply the answers?”</p>
<p>Question (1), the <span class="math inline">\(\$1B\)</span> dollar question, requires further research to provide a good answer. If the <strong>cartools</strong> package offers nothing else, a reader must come away knowing that collecting good data from controlled experiments and the good field data are essential. Once these data are obtained meaningful analyses can be conducted. Of course, even when objective is focused on the understanding the effects of traffic noise and controlling it, an interdisciplinary approach is necessary. This does not mean establishing an academic, interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers and statisticians. <span class="citation">Albino, Berardi, and Dangelico (2015)</span> state that there is no one formula for success but a clear need to engage policy makers from local communities. The cities of Chattanooga, TN and Syracuse, NY, have a good working relationships and a dialog with University of Tennessee and Syracuse University that can be tapped.</p>
<p><strong>Package Summary</strong></p>
<p>A quick read of the <strong>Home Analytical Tools Section</strong> may have given the impression that the goal to create the <strong>cartools</strong> package, a collection of <strong>R</strong> computer algorithms, will be overwhelming difficult to understand and implement. Words, like complex, dynamics, theory, parsimonious, stochastic and model integration can be daunting. No question that designing and operating a transportation system are difficult problems. Hopefully, by dissecting the problem into manageable pieces and synthesizing the results from the individual pieces brings clarity to the process. The ultimate aim of using <strong>cartools</strong> package tools is to improve our chances of mitigating congestion and improving performance using the simple mathematical and graphical tools.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p><em>What have we learned about traffic performance using the <strong>cartools</strong> package?</em> The most notable lesson learned is:</p>
<ul>
<li>By modeling driver behavior with a simple, parsimonious Brownian Bridge model of speed, it is possible to explain and forecast traffic breakdown on a ring-road and at a bottleneck.</li>
</ul>
<p>The potential of the <strong>cartools</strong> package as a learning tool has been demonstrated. Hopefully, this platform can be adapted and expanded to help users identify the root cause or causes for other congestion problems.</p>
<p>My next task is add HTML widgets and animation to the package. Adding these features will allow the user to simply conduct sensitivity analyses on-line. For example, the effects of speed and density on ring-road performance can be explored. Sliders for <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> will be provided so a user change them at will. The <strong>cartools</strong> package will instantaneously produce a histogram of head-ways as illustrated above.</p>
<p>This package is open to the public, <a href="https://github.com/PJOssenbruggen/Basic" class="uri">https://github.com/PJOssenbruggen/Basic</a>. In other words, I am inviting people to share their experiences with the package with me.
