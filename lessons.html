<p>As we carefully review the outcomes of the simulations derived from various deterministic and stochastic models, we must conclude that self-optimizing drivers are working against their own self interest in avoiding congestion and minimizing delay. Contrast the assumptions of the <strong>Zipper Merge</strong> and <strong>Traffic Breakdown Part 7</strong> simulations.</p>
<p>The <strong>Zipper Merge</strong> simulation assumes that drivers act in concert to align themselves before merging. The analysis suggests that drivers can successful merge at any speed, suggesting that high speed merges can take place. There is no empirical evidence to support this contention other than observing drivers on a race track.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Breakdown Part 7</strong> simulations assume that drivers act individually. Drivers have no incentive to give their counterparts room to maneuver. As a result, they promote delay. This kind of self-serving behavior is not new to traffic operations. It is known as <em>Braess’s Paradox</em> <span class="citation">(Braess, Nagurney, and Walkobinger 2005)</span>. It has been demonstrated both with mathematical models and with empirical evidence that closing certain roads in a roadway network can improve service. <span class="citation">Roughgarden and Tardos (2002)</span> reported that total delay using convex programming for a simple idealized “optimum” network would decrease delay by one-third over a “non-optimum” network.</p>
<p>Critics may claim that counter intuitive methods as suggested by the <em>Braess’s Paradox</em> approach has no application to traffic breakdown at a bottleneck. It is a far-fetched notion to assume the geometric layout of an interstate freeway interchange, say, can be improved in any meaningful or practical way. If so, it will be extraordinarily expensive. Secondly, training drivers to change their habits is social engineering requiring unobtainable behavioral changes. For example, drivers are taught that the right and left freeway lanes are reserved for slower and higher speed travel, respectively. Take any freeway of your choosing and observe that this teaching is not enforced by law enforcement and ignored by the majority of the driving public. Tailgating is common practice. Finally, critics can claim that the deterministic <strong>Zipper Merge</strong> model disregards traffic volatility, therefore it ignores a most fundamental premise of the work presented here in the <strong>cartools</strong> package. These are formidable criticisms.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligent Transportion Systems</strong></p>
<p>Here is a solution. Control traffic noise while leaving individual driver behavior more-or-less alone. How can this be done? Our answer is to apply <em>Intelligent Transportion Systems</em> (<em>ITS</em>) in a <em>smart city environment</em>.</p>
<p>Consider our following proof-of-concept project:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Collect real-time data.</strong> Collect data with lidar and radar equipment placed roadside or collected on-board a vehicle with a GPS system. Measures, including location <span class="math inline">\(x_{vehicle}(t)\)</span> and speed <span class="math inline">\(u_{vehicle}(t)\)</span> data will be transmitted using wireless technology and stored on a central controller computer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop a real-time forecast algorithm.</strong> The algorithm will be created along the lines of the <strong>Zipper Merge</strong> and <strong>brktrials2</strong> models. In lieu of simulating zipper and traffic breakdown merges, a <strong>brkzipper</strong> algorithm would be used to provide real-time information directed at the <em>individual driver</em>. “Optimumly derived” <span class="math inline">\({x}_{driver}(t)\)</span> locations and <span class="math inline">\({u}_{driver}(t)\)</span> speeds that minimize delay for all drivers. For example, instruct driver 3 on lane 2, who triggered the breakdown in the second <strong>Traffic Breakdown Part 7</strong> simulation, to maintain his or her speed and not decelerate. Driver 4 on lane would be given a similar instruction. By providing individualized instruction, an optimum solution is obtained.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use GPS to transmit individualized “optimized” driver instruction.</strong> To be effective, drivers will relinquish control of their vehicles. GPS coupled with a on-board vehicle control system will be used. The on-board system is contemplated to be similar to an autonomous cruise control (ACC) device, a device found on contemporary vehicles sold today. This is not social engineering. It is common sense. The driving public applauds, purchases and uses this kind of innovative technology.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Smart Cities and the Internet of Things</strong></p>
<p>“A smart city is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city</a>” Our proof-of-concept meets this definition.</p>
<p>However, a smart city involves more than collecting, analyzing and distributing data. While proof-of-concept project involves working with data for sure, <span class="citation">Albino, Berardi, and Dangelico (2015)</span> state that there is <strong>a clear need to engage policy makers from local communities.</strong> Take the <em>Uber Driverless-Car-Project</em> in the City of Pittsburgh for example <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/technology/pittsburgh-ubers-driverless-car-experiment.html" class="uri">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/technology/pittsburgh-ubers-driverless-car-experiment.html</a>. An Advanced Technology Center was opened for driverless car research, a benefit. However, Uber failed to honor its promises to form a meaningful partnership with the city. Uber promised to hire Hazelwood residents, help apply for a federal grant by providing seed money, share traffic data collected by lidar devices mounted on their cars, among other things. No Hazelwood residents were hired, the grant was denied and the data delivered to the city was insufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Student Learning:</strong> We feel that our proof-of-concept project provides, at minimum, a good learning experience for students in engineering and computer science <a href="http://eng-cs.syr.edu/transformation/" class="uri">http://eng-cs.syr.edu/transformation/</a>. It can be extended to be an excellent multidisciplinary effort where students from various disciplines work together. Two article that appear in the <em>Syracuse University Spring Magazine</em> 2018 issue describe exciting learning opportunities open to students provided by the <em>Maxwell X Lab</em>, <em>iSchool</em> and <em>Whitman School</em> <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/wp-content/uploads/sumagazine-2018-spring.pdf" class="uri">https://www.syracuse.edu/wp-content/uploads/sumagazine-2018-spring.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>In this age of <em>Big Data</em>, it is appropriate for public, private and educational institutions to share their knowledge and data resources. If nothing else is gained from the <strong>cartools</strong> website, a reader must realize good field data are essential. It may seem surprising that the data used in our studies is special. Why? It was continuously measured <em>24/7</em> over an eight month period. As importantly, it contains speed data. Typically, DOTs around nation do not collect speed data and only flow data. There are no speed data in <em>CNY</em>. It is impossible to conduct our proof-of-concept project.</p>
<p>We have established a dialog with University of Tennessee in Chattanooga, TN. “The Underground Infrastructure Sensing project, headed by UTC’s Dr. Dalei Wu in the College of Engineering and Computer Science, was chosen by Smart Cities Connect Media and Research for the award. The project is a collaboration with Dr. Dryer Huston at the University of Vermont.” <a href="https://blog.utc.edu/news/2018/03/utc-named-one-top-50-green-projects-country/" class="uri">https://blog.utc.edu/news/2018/03/utc-named-one-top-50-green-projects-country/</a>. <em>UTC</em> has recently embarked on a data collection effort on a major thoroughfare in the city as described above, <strong>Collect real-time data</strong>. We are thinking of establishing radar collection sites on I-81 somewhere in the City of Syracuse. One of these days, I-81 will be replaced. Bottleneck data could be used in a before-after study to determine the benefits obtained from replacing it. It could also prove to be of great value for planning to use <em>smart mobility systems</em> in the city in the future.</p>
<p><strong>The Academic Mission:</strong> Since no one unversity has all the resources at this point in time (maybe never) to tackle a <em>Big Data</em> project, we are reaching out to form partnerships with <em>SU</em>, <em>UTC</em> and <em>UVM</em>. As a starter, we would like discuss the possibility of talking with professors who will be working on senior projects for the spring semester of 2019. We know a few faculty advisers who work with local engineering firms and various government agencies. This is a tremendous resource. They will find it rewarding and may also discover that sharing information with GitHub and/or other open-source servers gives them and their students a valuable tool.</p>
<p>Denise Owen Harrigan states in her <em>Syracuse University Spring Magazine</em> article that “At Syracuse, Big Data is a big player. It’s steering academic programs in new directions, igniting interest throughout campus, and inspiring new research questions and innovative research methodologies.” We believe that our proof-of-concept project meets this criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Package Summary</strong></p>
<p>A quick read of the <strong>Home Analytical Tools Section</strong> may have given the impression that the goal to create the <strong>cartools</strong> package, a collection of <strong>R</strong> computer algorithms, will be overwhelming difficult to understand and implement. Words, like complex, dynamics, theory, parsimonious, stochastic and model integration can be daunting. No question that designing and operating a transportation system are difficult problems. Hopefully, by dissecting the problem into manageable pieces and synthesizing the results from the individual pieces brings clarity to the process. The ultimate aim of using <strong>cartools</strong> package tools is to improve our chances of mitigating congestion and improving performance using the simple mathematical and graphical tools.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p><em>What have we learned about traffic performance using the <strong>cartools</strong> package?</em> The most notable lesson learned is:</p>
<ul>
<li>By modeling driver behavior with a simple, parsimonious Brownian Bridge model of speed, it is possible to explain and forecast traffic breakdown on a ring-road and at a bottleneck.</li>
</ul>
<p>The potential of the <strong>cartools</strong> package as a learning tool has been demonstrated. Hopefully, this platform can be adapted and expanded to help users identify the root cause or causes for other congestion problems.</p>
<p>My next task is add HTML widgets and animation to the package. Adding these features will allow the user to simply conduct sensitivity analyses on-line. For example, the effects of speed and density on ring-road performance can be explored. Sliders for <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> will be provided so a user change them at will. The <strong>cartools</strong> package will instantaneously produce a histogram of head-ways as illustrated above.</p>
<p>This package is open to the public, <a href="https://github.com/PJOssenbruggen/Basic" class="uri">https://github.com/PJOssenbruggen/Basic</a>. In other words, I am inviting people to share their experiences with the package with me. See <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/" class="uri">https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/</a>.</p>
<p>GitHub promotes this activity. See <a href="https://github.com/explore" class="uri">https://github.com/explore</a>.</p>
