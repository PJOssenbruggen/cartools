abstract = {We analyze the characteristic features of jam formation on a circular one-lane road. We have applied an optimal velocity model including stochastic noise, where cars are treated as moving and interacting particles. The motion of N cars is described by the system of 2N stochastic differential equations with multiplicative white noise. Our system of cars behaves in qualitatively different ways depending on the values of control parameters c (dimensionless density), b (sensitivity parameter characterising the fastness of relaxation), and a (dimensionless noise intensity). In analogy to the gas-liquid phase transition in supersaturated vapour at low enough temperatures, we observe three different regimes of traffic flow at small enough values of b &lt; b <inf>cr</inf>. There is the free flow regime (like gaseous phase) at small densities of cars, the coexistence of a jam and free flow (like liquid and gas) at intermediate densities, and homogeneous dense traffic (like liquid phase) at large densities. The transition from free flow to congested traffic occurs when the homogeneous solution becomes unstable and evolves into the limit cycle. The opposite process takes place at a different density, so that we have a hysteresis effect and phase transition of the first order. A phase transition of second order, characterised by critical exponents, takes place at a certain critical density c = c<inf>cr</inf>. Inclusion of the stochastic noise allows us to calculate the distribution of headway distances and time headways between the successive cars, as well as the distribution of jam (car cluster) sizes in a congested traffic.},

The model integrates spillback congestion into an existing formulation of the \{DTA\} based on continuous-time variables and implicit path enumeration, which is capable of explicitly representing the formation and dispersion of vehicle queues on road links, but allows them to exceed the arc length. The propagation of congestion among adjacent arcs will be achieved through the introduction of time-varying exit and entry capacities that limit the inflow on downstream arcs in such a way that their storage capacities are never exceeded. Determining the temporal profile of these capacity constraints requires solving a system of spatially non-separable macroscopic flow models on the supply side of the \{DTA\} based on the theory of kinematic waves, which describe the dynamic of the spillback phenomenon and yield consistent network performances for given arc flows. We also devise a numerical solution algorithm of the proposed continuous-time formulation allowing for “long time intervals” of several minutes, and give an empirical evidence of its convergence. Finally, we carry out a thorough experimentation in order to estimate the relevance of spillback modeling in the context of the DTA, compare the proposed model in terms of effectiveness with the Cell Transmission Model, and assess the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and its applicability to real instances with large networks.

abstract = {The study aims to develop a novel evolution model of speed perturbations for quantifying the probability of the traffic flow breakdown on congested freeway flow. The model is applicable to freeway operation and management. Time headway, driver behavior, and state transitions with stochastic nature are the most important factors for the breakdown and recovery of a disturbance. Two types of drivers, "adventurers" and "conservatives," and two styles of reacting behavior, "copy" and "shift" are defined to characterize driving behavior. The time headway distributions for arriving and discharging traffic are distinguished for the existence of the "hysteresis" phenomenon. The Monte Carlo simulation is carried out to obtain the estimation of the probability of breakdown (PB). The calculated PB is a monotonically increasing function of freeway flow with an "S" shape. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model can describe the changes in spatial extent and magnitude of a disturbance, which have potential use for future works and field applications.},

The focus of the research presented in this paper was to develop probabilistic models to predict breakdown of flow by using data from five freeway-ramp merging segments. The development of the probabilistic models allows exploration of several issues: the identification of breakdown, the performance measures for the identification of the breakdown, and the breakdown location. The breakdown probability model (BPM) is based on lifetime data analysis statistics. The breakdown probability models can be very useful tools in establishing capacity values, which in turn can be part of the freeway traffic management process.

abstract = {It is explained why the set of the fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown (a transition from free flow to congested traffic) should be the empirical basis for any traffic and transportation theory that can be reliably used for control and optimization in traffic networks. It is shown that the generally accepted fundamentals and methodologies of the traffic and transportation theory are not consistent with the set of the fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck. To these fundamentals and methodologies of the traffic and transportation theory belong (i) Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) theory, (ii) the General Motors (GM) model class (for example, Herman, Gazis et al. GM model, Gipps's model, Payne's model, Newell's optimal velocity (OV) model, Wiedemann's model, Bando et al. OV model, Treiber's IDM, Krau&szlig;'s model), (iii) the understanding of highway capacity as a particular (fixed or stochastic) value, and (iv) principles for traffic and transportation network optimization and control (for example, Wardrop's user equilibrium (UE) and system optimum (SO) principles). Alternatively to these generally accepted fundamentals and methodologies of the traffic and transportation theory, we discuss the three-phase traffic theory as the basis for traffic flow modeling as well as briefly consider the network breakdown minimization (BM) principle for the optimization of traffic and transportation networks with road bottlenecks. &copy; 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We investigate a utility-based approach for driver car-following behavioral modeling while analyzing different aspects of the model characteristics especially in terms of capturing different fundamental diagram regions and safety proxy indices. The adopted model came from an elementary thought where drivers associate subjective utilities for accelerations (i.e. gain in travel times) and subjective dis-utilities for decelerations (i.e. loss in travel time) with a perceived probability of being involved in rear-end collision crashes. Following the testing of the model general structure, the authors translate the corresponding behavioral psychology theory - prospect theory - into an efficient microscopic traffic modeling with more elaborate stochastic characteristics considered in a risk-taking environment.After model formulation, we explore different model disaggregate and aggregate characteristics making sure that fidelity is kept in terms of equilibrium properties. Significant effort is then dedicated to calibrating and validating the model using microscopic trajectory data. A modified genetic algorithm is adopted for this purpose while focusing on capturing inter-driver heterogeneity for each of the parameters. Using the calibration exercise as a starting point, simulation sensitivity analysis is performed to reproduce different fundamental diagram regions and to explore rear-end collisions related properties. In terms of fundamental diagram regions, the model in hand is able to capture traffic breakdowns and different instabilities in the congested region represented by flow-density data points scattering. In terms of incident related measures, the effect of heterogeneity in both psychological factors and execution/perception errors on the accidents number and their distribution is studied. Through sensitivity analysis, correlations between the crash-penalty, the negative coefficient associated with losses in speed, the positive coefficient associated with gains in speed, the driver's uncertainty, the anticipation time and the reaction time are retrieved. The formulated model offers a better understanding of driving behavior, particularly under extreme/incident conditions. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The approach is intended for predicting travel time variability caused by such stochastic phenomena. It is assumed that breakdown may occur at different flow levels with some probability and would sustain for a random duration. This is modeled at the microscopic level by considering speed changes that are initiated by a leading vehicle and propagated by the following vehicles with correlated-distributed behavioral parameters. Numerical results from a Monte Carlo simulation demonstrate that the proposed stochastic modeling approach produces a realistic macroscopic traffic flow behavior and can be used to generate travel time distributions.},

abstract = {In many multicast routing protocols, Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (for short, PIM-SM) has been studied and implemented. Data transmission in the PIM-SM domain is performed on a shared tree. The shared tree has a Rendezvous Point (RP) which plays a central role of the data transmission. The bootstrap mechanism is one of the methods to discover the RP dynamically in the PIM-SM domain. However, because the mechanism needs data flooding for all routers to find the RP, some traffic or congestion is prone to occur on the domain. The processing of the mechanism is also time-consuming. In this paper, a hybrid bootstrap mechanism in PIM-SM is proposed and its performance is evaluated. Since the proposed method consists of distributed and centralized processes, it is called a hybrid one. The key for the proposed method is that the role of the RP selection is played in a Bootstrap Router, not that a Designated Router, since the RP-Set distribution is not performed. Especially, the proposed method dose not need the flooding and can be reduced the processing time efficiently to discover the RP. Simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce the processing time by more than 40% compared with that of the conventional one.},

abstract = {The study aims to develop a novel evolution model of speed perturbations for quantifying the probability of the traffic flow breakdown on congested freeway flow. The model is applicable to freeway operation and management. Time headway, driver behavior, and state transitions with stochastic nature are the most important factors for the breakdown and recovery of a disturbance. Two types of drivers, "adventurers" and "conservatives," and two styles of reacting behavior, "copy" and "shift" are defined to characterize driving behavior. The time headway distributions for arriving and discharging traffic are distinguished for the existence of the "hysteresis" phenomenon. The Monte Carlo simulation is carried out to obtain the estimation of the probability of breakdown (PB). The calculated PB is a monotonically increasing function of freeway flow with an "S" shape. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model can describe the changes in spatial extent and magnitude of a disturbance, which have potential use for future works and field applications.},

abstract = {The term breakdown of flow at a freeway bottleneck location has been used to describe the transition from relatively free-flowing traffic to congestion, often called stop-and-go traffic, but more generally experienced as slow-and-go. The focus of the research presented in this paper was to develop probabilistic models to predict breakdown of flow by using data from five freeway-ramp merging segments. The development of the probabilistic models allows exploration of several issues: the identification of breakdown, the performance measures for the identification of the breakdown, and the breakdown location. The breakdown probability model (BPM) is based on lifetime data analysis statistics. The breakdown probability models can be very useful tools in establishing capacity values, which in turn can be part of the freeway traffic management process.

abstract = {It is explained why the set of the fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown (a transition from free flow to congested traffic) should be the empirical basis for any traffic and transportation theory that can be reliably used for control and optimization in traffic networks. It is shown that the generally accepted fundamentals and methodologies of the traffic and transportation theory are not consistent with the set of the fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck. To these fundamentals and methodologies of the traffic and transportation theory belong (i) Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) theory, (ii) the General Motors (GM) model class (for example, Herman, Gazis et al. GM model, Gipps's model, Payne's model, Newell's optimal velocity (OV) model, Wiedemann's model, Bando et al. OV model, Treiber's IDM, Krau&szlig;'s model), (iii) the understanding of highway capacity as a particular (fixed or stochastic) value, and (iv) principles for traffic and transportation network optimization and control (for example, Wardrop's user equilibrium (UE) and system optimum (SO) principles). Alternatively to these generally accepted fundamentals and methodologies of the traffic and transportation theory, we discuss the three-phase traffic theory as the basis for traffic flow modeling as well as briefly consider the network breakdown minimization (BM) principle for the optimization of traffic and transportation networks with road bottlenecks. &copy; 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We investigate a utility-based approach for driver car-following behavioral modeling while analyzing different aspects of the model characteristics especially in terms of capturing different fundamental diagram regions and safety proxy indices. The adopted model came from an elementary thought where drivers associate subjective utilities for accelerations (i.e. gain in travel times) and subjective dis-utilities for decelerations (i.e. loss in travel time) with a perceived probability of being involved in rear-end collision crashes. Following the testing of the model general structure, the authors translate the corresponding behavioral psychology theory - prospect theory - into an efficient microscopic traffic modeling with more elaborate stochastic characteristics considered in a risk-taking environment.After model formulation, we explore different model disaggregate and aggregate characteristics making sure that fidelity is kept in terms of equilibrium properties. Significant effort is then dedicated to calibrating and validating the model using microscopic trajectory data. A modified genetic algorithm is adopted for this purpose while focusing on capturing inter-driver heterogeneity for each of the parameters. Using the calibration exercise as a starting point, simulation sensitivity analysis is performed to reproduce different fundamental diagram regions and to explore rear-end collisions related properties. In terms of fundamental diagram regions, the model in hand is able to capture traffic breakdowns and different instabilities in the congested region represented by flow-density data points scattering. In terms of incident related measures, the effect of heterogeneity in both psychological factors and execution/perception errors on the accidents number and their distribution is studied. Through sensitivity analysis, correlations between the crash-penalty, the negative coefficient associated with losses in speed, the positive coefficient associated with gains in speed, the driver's uncertainty, the anticipation time and the reaction time are retrieved. The formulated model offers a better understanding of driving behavior, particularly under extreme/incident conditions. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The results show that the increasing of probe vehicle percentage could somehow improve the prediction accuracy for travel time, however, this improvement is not significant as the increase of the number of probe vehicles is not linearly increased with the increase of traffic volume (up to highly congested network).},

abstract = {In many multicast routing protocols, Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (for short, PIM-SM) has been studied and implemented. Data transmission in the PIM-SM domain is performed on a shared tree. The shared tree has a Rendezvous Point (RP) which plays a central role of the data transmission. The bootstrap mechanism is one of the methods to discover the RP dynamically in the PIM-SM domain. However, because the mechanism needs data flooding for all routers to find the RP, some traffic or congestion is prone to occur on the domain. The processing of the mechanism is also time-consuming. In this paper, a hybrid bootstrap mechanism in PIM-SM is proposed and its performance is evaluated. Since the proposed method consists of distributed and centralized processes, it is called a hybrid one. The key for the proposed method is that the role of the RP selection is played in a Bootstrap Router, not that a Designated Router, since the RP-Set distribution is not performed. Especially, the proposed method dose not need the flooding and can be reduced the processing time efficiently to discover the RP. Simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce the processing time by more than 40% compared with that of the conventional one.},
